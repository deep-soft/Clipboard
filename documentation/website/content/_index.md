The Clipboard Project (CB for short) is the <i>oh-so-awesome</i> clipboard manager that's just like a second brain.

It's fast and lightweight, feature packed, and super user friendly.

Do way more on the computer in way less time!

# Easy to use

Anyone can use CB - no matter who you are or what you're working on, from web developers to your Average Joe and even to your grandma. Nothing dares lay more than a few button presses away.

# Feature packed

We've packed, crammed, and <i>jammed</i> CB full of useful features to increase your productivity in the most effective way possible. Make infinitely different clipboards, manipulate them with full-fat regex, instantly script them all, and way more.

# Tastefully stylish

Can you get diabetes from too much eye candy?

Well, that's a question we're still figuring out how to solve. But in the meantime, know that CB is filled with just enough eye candy to be gorgeous - and not put you into a sugar coma.

# Featherlight

When you install CB, it won't take up gigabytes of your precious storage space storing useless junk, unlike some other apps out there. And, dare we say it, it's also <i>blazingly fast</i> thanks to our use of the latest and greatest code compiling technologies.

# Open and secure

## Let's start saving time and effort.

Start by copying the words "Hello Clipboard!"

```sh
$ cb copy "Hello Clipboard!"
```

Not so bad, right!

Now try copying some of your files.

```sh
$ cb copy FileOne FileTwo FolderThree
```

Notice how we have two files and a folder? 

That's one of CB's superpowers: you can copy anything, anytime, anywhere.

Let's kick it up a notch.

```sh
$ CLIPBOARD_THEME=green cb -fc -nc -np cp_500 *.txt *.png
```

Ok, so maybe we kicked it up too many notches. But you get the idea - although CB is super easy to use, you can do a lot of things, and me mean <i>a whole lot</i>, with it.
