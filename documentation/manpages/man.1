work with many, including X11, Wayland, Windows, macOS, Haiku, and OSC
52.

.SS FILES
.PP
\f[B]cb\f[R] stores its temporary data in the \f[B]Clipboard\f[R]
subdirectory in a system-provided temporary folder or in the
\f[B].clipboard\f[R] subdirectory in the user\[cq]s home folder.
\f[B]cb\f[R] is also XDG-compliant, prioritizing the relevant XDG
directories over the defaults if available.
